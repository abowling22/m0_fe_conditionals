Comparison opperators can be a little tricky based on the wording of the prompt. I'd say I understand the premise for it, but will be doing more practice with it over the next day and in the coming weeks. 

The logical operators were easier for me to understand. || demands only 1 of the conditions is correct whereas && requires both conditions to be met. 

If statements are going to take sometime as well. Learning the syntax around it is something I have to practice to get better at. 

I need to practice more. All of this is something I need to get more comfortable with, and I'll be looking at challenge 3 later tonight once all my assignments are done.  I feel like ill be comfortable completing mod 0 still, but in the weeks before mod 1 ill need to practice more in the time leading up to Mod 1
